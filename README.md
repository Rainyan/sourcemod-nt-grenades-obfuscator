# sourcemod-nt-grenades-obfuscator
Neotokyo SourceMod plugin. Make frags and smokes indistinguishable by using the same model for both.

The rationale for this change is preventing players from making it [unfairly obvious](https://gamebanana.com/mods/234537)
whether the grenade that landed nearby is an actual threat, forcing them out of cover, essentially
making it impossible to flush them out with a "fake grenade" that was actually a smoke.
